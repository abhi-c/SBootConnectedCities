This file speak about how to run the poject and basic trouble shooting.

How to run: 
	This is a spring boot app. run command "mvn clean install".
	Later run the jar file in target folder using is java -jar SBootConnectedCities-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
    default URL would be http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
    In case you want to change the port from 8080. edit application.properties to specify it using server.port=<port number>

Log: 
   Simple logger is used for two classes for debugging. Considering the time only relevant classes have loggers
   It prints the datastructure of all the direct connections
   
Troubleshooting:
	Make sure the port used here is free to use. Default is 8080
	
Limitations:
	1) Its case sensitive
	2) Spaces before/after a city name matters
	3) first line in csv is not read
	4) every line should have 2 cities separate with comma
	5) empty line is not handled. It will throw error. This code is targeting happy path/positive testcases.
	6) Edge cases like no origin or destination etc are not covered. Left for enhancement 

Please go through readme.txt
